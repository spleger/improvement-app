# Raw Feedback Log

"Most importantly, when creating a new challenge or new challenges underneath a goal, like nested under a goal, connected to a goal, it creates them, I think, but they do not show up underneath the goal visually. So at the dashboard, after creating new challenges the challenges do not show up, the new ones. Old ones seem to do, but new ones do not show up.

Tracking works, but I mean it works mostly, but it doesn't look nice. We need also the icons for the drop-down list are misplaced. The first one works for log habits, but then the voice diary one is to the right of log habits, not in the next line. And the same goes for the chart of the check-in. Which brings me to my next thing. The navigation works except for the check-in. Check-in actually leads you or redirects you to the progress page, not a check-in page. So that needs to be fixed. If I then enter from the progress page, if I scroll all the way down, I am able to click daily check-in. That opens the daily check-in page. That one's supposed to be connected to the drop-down item check-in. And make sure to change the icon as well. We do not want charts there. We want the check-in icon there.

When logging habits, so on the habits page, if I click the the microphone icon, it does open up the voice habit log box, but it opens it up below all of the habits. It should not be below the habits, it should be in front of the habits. So it should basically replace most of the page with this interface that is the voice habit log. If possible, make it a little bit see-through, just like we've done with some of the other implementations. Also, for voice in general, I would like to have the I would like to have one consistent way of doing this. I personally believe it's good enough if we just have this pulsing icon in the middle and then you can click it to finish and actually yeah, scrap that. I think I would like to have this pulsing icon. If you click it, you finish, but then you also have the option to at the bottom two buttons that are stop recording and pause or stop and pause so the user can really interact with this in a smooth way. And the exact same goes for the voice diary. I want the exact same um functionality and style for the voice diary, please.

Lastly, at the progress on the progress page, um I th I think there's supposed to be a mood and energy trends uh graph, but it doesn't really graph anything, it's just like three different lines at the very bottom. So I think that needs fixing as well to properly plot that graph.

And then we have one more bucket, which is the expert chat. The expert chat itself is a little bit lower, but there's two issues. Still, it is not filling the entire screen. So there's still a black bar between the expert chat block and the navigation block at the bottom. Fix that, make sure that those two are connected. No matter if which dimensions the screen that it's viewed on is, it always has to be connected. The widget, the element that is the expert chat, that box, and the navigation bar below. And at the top, same thing, currently, not the same thing, but at the top, it's actually cut away, so the top navigation bar actually overlaps and overrides some of the expert chat box. So you can't properly see the drop-down, for example, for selecting the coach. And talking about selecting the coach, the window that opens when clicking the select coach drop-down, the drop-down, like the new window that opens that has all of the coaches, needs to be like every single item for the representing the different coaches needs to be spaced properly. That is consistent with each other in a grid, but then also using the full the full width of the screen."
