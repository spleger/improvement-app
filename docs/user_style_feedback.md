# User Design & Style Feedback

This document captures your specific feedback and requirements regarding the application's design style.

## Exact Quotes & Requirements (General)

> "I want a glassmorphism look, dark mode but with teal accents not purple, and fix the nav to be just 4 items: Home, Diary, Habits, Expert. Make the cards look like frosted glass."

> "Make the expert chat have a microphone button."

> "Make sure the headings are consistent."

> "also, you can just push the changes to github, the v2 branch pls and I can then view it on my phone via vercel"

## Detailed Feedback per Section

### Homepage

- **Overall**: "Could use some more modern design in general."
- **Goals & Challenges**: "Adding goal, adding challenges could use a little bit of a border to make it clearer."
- **Squished Design**: "the design of the goal feels kind of squished currently."
- **Buttons**: "buttons for finishing a goal and deleting a goal could be bigger and maybe there's some text that feels oddly spaced."
- **Normalization**: "could use a bit more normalization of the design."
- **Today's Challenges**: "could use a border and stats could be in the middle, maybe."
- **Misplaced Options**: "below that, you have like options that don't really belong here, right? Like log habits, voice diary, check-in, etc. They should all be in the navigation menu."

### Navigation Bar

- **Current Bug**: "once I click on progress then is when the habits tab vanishes at the bottom and instead there's diary. We cannot have that."
- **Top Bar Proposal**: "have a top bar as well where you have some basic information maybe where you display like ongoing the ongoing challenge... and then definitely also the profile and maybe home as well."
- **Bottom Bar**: "definitely diary habits and expert I think that is good enough for the navigation." (Implemented: Home, Diary, Habits, Expert).

### Progress

- **Header**: "Top as well the design the spacing is not really great... the icon looks kind of weird directly below that got a little bit of text but it's also not not looking very well."
- **Spacing**: "Spacing between the Overview section and last 30 days is a little bit too low. I'd like it to be a bit bigger."
- **Calendar Visualization**: "I'm starting from the bottom right and then I'm moving up feels kind of weird. We need to brainstorm a better way to visualize the progress."
- **Context**: "Also there's no real way to connect this to the actual date that this was started on... If a person has multiple goals then this just seems kind of weird."
- **Redundant Nav**: "you get two navigation pieces below that which is dashboard and which is home. So why is it called that? And also daily check-in which is colored differently. Don't really think that makes sense."
- **Visual Separation**: "it seems like there is like a very very slight... separation between the different sections... but you can't really see it and I think that's a good idea some some chunking to make it feel more modern."

### Habits

- **Overall**: "Habits page looks really good in general."
- **Design Uniformity**: "I think it could be a nicer design maybe if the heading is in the middle and then you got a better way to put the subheading underneath... design should be uniform across all different pages."
- **Voice Log**: "looking nice, but it doesn't really fit to the rest of the style. If... the heading would also be boxed in some capacity, the box of the voice log I think would look better."

### Diary

- **Spacing Issue**: "it just feels so close to the top... It's like it feels unfinished."
- **Boxed Layout**: "Depending on the style that we're going through, could also be boxed in some capacity. Right now it's just text on background."
- **Entries**: "It could really use some form of boxing to separate the actual entry, the date, the duration and the AI analysis... and block it all together in one unit."

### Expert Chat

- **Height Issue**: "Currently the chat window doesn't fill the complete length of the window... which is terrible for user experience."
- **Positive**: "The rest, like the design of that one is actually really nice. Otherwise, I really enjoy it."

### Profile & Settings

- **Profile Image**: "It'd be great if one could upload a picture for the profile page and also maybe for the home page somewhere."
- **Goals**: "I think we shouldn't have the ability to add new goals here in the profile page."
- **Settings Design**: "boxing could use a little bit more separation."
- **Sliders**: "The sliders for the challenge generation feels way too squished."
- **Checkboxes**: "like the check boxes should be better."
- **Positive**: "safe settings, I really like the green. That's a really cool thing."
