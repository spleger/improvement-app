## 🎨 Global Design Notes

1. **Boxing/Cards**: Most sections need clearer card-style boxing for visual separation
2. **Consistent spacing**: Normalize padding/margins across all pages
3. **Modern design**: Research and implement design system best practices
4. **Uniform styling**: All pages should share the same visual language
5. **Dark mode specific**: All feedback based on dark mode view
